# Draw On Desk
## Or how to draw on your computer screen easily and for free

### What is Draw On Desk ?

  A simple application made with **Python** and **Tkinter**, to draw on your screen, if you want to show easily 
things and explain what you're talking about when you share your screen on stream.
  I wanted to create a project using **Python**, and this tool was an idea I got some time ago, while 
streaming to a friend to show something, and pointing things with my finger like an idiot.

### How to use that tool ? 
#### Launch the app

  Just clone the project (or download it from **Itch.io** : [link]) and click on the executable.
Maybe your antivirus will analyse it, but I promise, it's **safe**. I also put the source code, if
you want to add some functionnalities or modify what you want. Feel free to use my code, I'll be happy 
to see what you make with it.
